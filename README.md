**Air Monitoring System (Tinkercad Simulation)**

**📌 Project Overview**

This project is a simulated Air Monitoring System built using Arduino Uno and sensors in Tinkercad Circuits.
The system is designed to monitor air quality parameters such as harmful gases, temperature, or humidity and give alerts using LEDs or displays.
It was developed as part of a college project submission under the IoT/ISD subject to demonstrate the integration of hardware, sensors, and Arduino programming for environmental monitoring.

**⚡ Features**

📊 Air Quality Monitoring using MQ sensor (e.g., MQ-135).
🌡 Environmental Data: Can be extended to temperature & humidity sensors.
💡 Visual Alerts: LED indicators for safe / unsafe air conditions.
🔌 Arduino Uno Integration with breadboard circuit.
🖥 Tinkercad Simulation for easy reproduction and testing.

**🛠 Components Used**

Arduino Uno
MQ Gas Sensor (MQ-135 / MQ-7)
Breadboard & Jumper Wires
LEDs (Red, Green, Yellow)
Resistors
LCD Display Module

**🧑‍💻 How It Works**

The MQ gas sensor detects harmful gas concentration in the air.
Sensor values are read by the Arduino Uno.
Based on threshold values:
🟢 Green LED = Safe air
🟡 Yellow LED = Moderate air quality
🔴 Red LED = Unsafe air / Alert
Data and alerts are displayed in the Tinkercad serial monitor.
